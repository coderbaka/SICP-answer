These are my answers of SICP book.
All answer goes in answer.md,but if you want runable code,check out programs folder.Note that answer.md contains latex code, and some answers are Chinese.
All answer are mostly checked by comparing with other public answers(https://wizardbook.wordpress.com/solutions-index/ and http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions).
The environment that I test the code is Linux,MIT-Scheme.
